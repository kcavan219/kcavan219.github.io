### CPSC 120

* [Lab 8] (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-brooke-and-kaitlyn)

     In Lab 8 Part-1, I found the exploration of standard error messages and the utilization of std::cerr particularly engaging. The lab provided valuable practice in initializing a vector of arguments using arguments.at().

* [Lab 9] (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-kaitlyn-and-kieren) 

     Lab 9 Part-1 presented a challenging task that required extensive variable assignment. This exercise significantly enhanced my proficiency in assigning variables to various values, contributing to my overall skill development.

* [Lab 10] (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-kieren-and-kaitlyn)

     Lab 10 Part-2 involved an extensive application of vector operations. I found difficulty in aligning the vector placement with the given arguments initially. However, upon realizing the misalignment, fixing the code became straightforward. This lab proved to be my favorite among the three, as it delved deep into vector manipulationsâ€”a concept I found both challenging and intriguing in comparison to other topics covered in the course.
